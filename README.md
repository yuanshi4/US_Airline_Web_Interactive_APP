# US_Airline_Web_Interactive_APP

In this project, I created an user-interactive web app, that you can select a specific airline, and it will show a US map with #flights that your selected has delayed in all airports across the US. 

Instruction to run the app:

- cd the directory of your app
- run 'python US_Airline_app.py 

The jupyter notebook report contains meta data info, and many other useful info about this app.
