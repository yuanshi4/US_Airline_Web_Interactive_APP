# US_Airline_Web_Interactive_APP

In this project, I created an user-interactive web app, that you can select a specific airline, and it will show a US map with #flights that your selected has delayed in all airports across the US. 

Instruction to run the app:

- Download the airline cancellation data at: https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays
- Make sure you have Dash installed
- In terminal, cd the directory of your app
- Run 'python US_Airline_app.py 

The jupyter notebook report contains meta data info, and many other useful info about this app. 

- In order to run the app locally, make sure to download the airline cancellation data at: https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays
